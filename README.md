# LSTM_VAR_Thesis
Econometrics Masters Thesis done by Emery Karambiri about creating a specialized LSTM cell that can model linear dependencies within multivariate time series data explicitly.

All experiments are put in a separate Jupyter notebook. This notebook contains two sections: first the section to run the experiments, second the section that plots the results. The results get saved in the folders for the respective experiment when run.
